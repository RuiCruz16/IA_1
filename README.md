## How to run

- Create a virtual python environment and activate it
```
python -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

- Install the dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- Run the script (You must ensure there is a reliable internet connection as the script downloads the dataset from kaggle)
```
python main.py
```

- Then you just have to select the algorithm you desire to explore and give the asked inputs. Apart from the graphs in the UI, the results can also be consulted in a generated CSV file.
